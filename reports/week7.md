### Justin Primc:
**Goals planned for this week:**
- Complete information documents: USER/DEVELOPER GUIDELINES
- Solve local data storage issue

**Team progress and issues:**
- **What team member did:** Completed both md files for the user and developer guidelines. Edited the index.js file to include a save locally feature for users' syllabi data. Added necessary files (milestone.json) for implementation into a Chrome extension.
- **What worked:** Using outside tools when needed (Google Chrome extension developer guides)
- **What team member learned:** I learned how to start creating a Chrome extension and the specific files and permissions you need to implement these.
- **Where the team member had trouble and where the team member is stuck:** I initially had trouble figuring out what was needed to save user data locally. I later learned how this works when using a Chrome extension through the Chrome provided guidelines.

**Goals planned for next week:**
- Add CI automated tests
- Fix any new issues found through the testing process in the frontend section
