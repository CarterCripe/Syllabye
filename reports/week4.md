# Week 4: Architecture and Design

## Team Report (Group 13)

### Goals planned for this week:
- Complete any missing pieces in previously assigned project milestones (Milestone 1 & 2), specifically our project report and goals for the project.

### Team progress and issues:
- **What the team did:** Completed unfinished pieces of previous project milestones 1 & 2 by adding the Primary and Stretch Goals for the project. The requirements section that has three user stories and three non-functional requirements, and any external requirements required for the project. Along with updating each of the team members' roles to fit the scope of the project.
- **What worked:** Successfully aligned team documentation with assigned milestones
- **What team learned:** Learned the basics of creating a webpage extension through the React interface.
- **Where the team had trouble and where the team is stuck:** The team is not stuck currently; we are just slightly behind in the completion of the project milestones.

### Goals planned for next week:
- Complete any remaining milestones (#3) (1 day)
- Start work on backend application (3 days)
- Create rough draft of frontend page layout using React (3 days)

## Contributions of Individual Team Members

### Brennan Duman:
**Goals planned for this week:**
- Complete Milestone 1 by developing goals for minimum viable product, as well as potential stretch goals such as assignment notifications and 'importance' based assignment sorting.
- Complete Milestone 2 by completing the 'Team Process Description'. Specify the software stack, a rough schedule for each team member, major risks that could lead to an uncompleted project, and when to seek external feedback.

**Team progress and issues:**
- **What team member did:** Spearheaded team effort to catch up on past milestones during Thursday meeting. 
- **What worked:** Being able to sit down with the group and effectively communicate the areas where effort was needed.
- **What team member learned:** Learned how to better communicate with the rest of the team, as well as the various systems needed to update the customer (aka the teaching staff).
- **Where the team member had trouble and where the team member is stuck:** In terms of the work done, it was fairly straight forward. Not currently stuck, but is unfamiliar with the React, and may require help from external developers and online sources to learn the framework. \[Edit - 2/4: Was unable to complete this report to a satisfactory condition. Will take additional time to write out granularity and be as specific as possible for reports moving forward.\]

**Goals planned for next week:**
- Create page layout for frontend (1 day)
- Learn the basics of React (2 days)
- Implement layout using React (2 days)
    * This implementation will consist solely of navigation between pages. Styling and other content will not be applied, apart from a short text description describing the basic function each page will fulfill.

### Carter Cripe:
**Goals planned for this week:** Quantify project architecture by determining frontend and backend software choices

**Team progress and issues:** 
- **What team member did:** Expanded on existing project plan by adding sections for project architecture and technical requirements, and researched google's extension system. 
- **What worked:** Meeting with the whole group to discus areas where people had experience and which areas we wanted to avoid for the project.
- **What team member learned:** I learned that the google extension system is very simple to work with, and for us to make our site into an extension we can build our project as if it was a normal website, and then convert it into an extension later on into the project once we have the framework in place.
- **Where the team member had trouble and where the team member is stuck:** There were no issues with the project process, but one issue that I had was that I initially forgot to fill out this section of the report which became an issue. We as a group also had some issues with the quality of our report, and so we met as a team to improve our report. 

**Goals planned for next week:**
- Create a function layout of the project backend containing input / output structure, as well as data processing plan

### Justin Primc:
**Goals planned for this week:** Finalized project idea and plan

**Team progress and issues:**
- **What team member did:** Completed most of the group's weekly report and added the basic formatting for the reports moving into upcoming weeks. Helped update team sections of the shared document. Also worked on  completing the Requirements section of the document, which included a user story, three non-functional requirements, and the assigned external requirements.
- **What worked:** Following the given basic structure for the report and using previous knowledge in how to create user stories and non-functional requirements made it a fairly simple task. Communcaion between teammates to assign tasks and plan for the upcoming weeks.
- **What team member learned:** Learned how to better communicate with the members within this project, and with the teaching staff.
- **Where team member had trouble and where team member is stuck:** No real challenges other than getting the report formatting to match that which the professor requires.

**Goals planned for next week:**
- Learn the basics of React (2 days)
- Finish all Milestone 3 pieces (1 day)
