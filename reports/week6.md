# Week 6: Project Requirement Elicitation

## Team Report (Group 13)

### Goals planned for this week:
- Implement the rough draft of frontend UI layout using HTML/CSS/JS that was previously implemented in Google Drawings
- Determine the specific format for JSON files containing processed data
- Implement backend processing method for initialization of a Syllabus

### Team progress and issues:
- **What the team did:** Completed presentation deliverable 2, presented project presentation on Thursday afternoon. Created backend JSON syllabus processing format.
- **What worked:** Communicating which pieces of the presentation each member would be responsible for allowed each member to complete their slides and prepare to present effectively.
- **What team learned:**
- **Where the team had trouble and where the team is stuck:**
    - Presentation for Deliverable 2 had to be rushed at the end due to overly lengthy explanations of previous slides

### Goals planned for next week:
- Complete any implementation and documentation level requirements for milestone 4
- Finish backend syllabus initialization process
- Add complex question answering route to backend API and create processing plan
- Begin implimenting an automated testing system for the backend

## Contributions of Individual Team Members

### Brennan Duman:
**Goals planned for this week:**
- Implement frontend from UI draft

**Team progress and issues:**
- **What team member did:**
    - Worked on Deliverable 2 presentation
        - reduced excess/distracting descriptions
        - created graphics
        - set testing deadlines
    - Finished Milestone 3
        - Created testing plan for frontend
        - Created outline/layout for product-shipping documentation
    - Began work on frontend implementation
        - screen switching
        - initial styling
- **What worked:**
    - The presentation was a success
    - Removed all react related temp files in src/frontend/ and created file structure for HTML implementation
    - Created system for switching between the different 'screens' of the frontend
- **What team member learned:**
    - CSS inheritance doesn't uniformly apply for :hover
    - Google Chrome dev-tools actively point out issues like input fields not having a referencable ID
- **Where the team member had trouble and where the team member is stuck:**  
    - Haven't created wrapper/temp functions for use in API call
    - Haven't looked into file input field styling & conventions

**Goals planned for next week:**
- Set up PDF -> TXT conversion
- Finish styling
- Create functions to interact with API
- User testing

### Carter Cripe:
**Goals planned for this week:**
- Create comprehensive API documentation in order to give the frontend designers a clear idea of how to integrate the frontend with the backend API
- Determine a processing plan for the data to maximise utility
- Impliment a basic version of the syllabus initialization containing core features in order to allow the frontend to use it for testing
**Team progress and issues:**
- **What team member did:**
    - Determined the proper processing format for the main backend API /process route
    - Worked on presentation content regarding the backend
    - Created function layout for processing with placeholder values
- **What worked:**
    - The presentation was successful, we were well prepared
    - The decided upon processing format will provide a great deal of flexibility for the application
- **What team member learned:**
    - There are a lot of ways to solve a problem like the processing format, but there are no perfect solutions, each solution has drawbacks, and I have to find the solution that is the best fit for the project
- **Where the team member had trouble and where the team member is stuck:**
    - I made a lot of progress this week, and now that I have a definite processing plan, the implimentation will be simple. That being said, I have to configure the backend properly going forward to work with the frontend.

**Goals planned for next week:**
    - Finish implimentation the main processing unit for syllabus implimentation
    - Create implimentation plan the secondary complex-question answering system
    

### Justin Primc:
**Goals planned for this week:**
- Create the project slideshow for the deliverable 2 presentation
- Complete milestone 3 document pieces.

**Team progress and issues:**
- **What team member did:**
      - Worked on Deliverable 2 presentation
        - Created a basic-level initial slideshow which included all of the fundamental requirements for the presentation, each slide contained multiple bullet points of key information.
        - Fully polished introductory slides for presentation, Problem Overview, Project Motivation & Importance, Proposed Solution, and Architecture/Design pt 1.
    - Finished Milestone 3
        - Created a testing plan for both the backend and integration layers.
- **What worked:** Presentation went well, and I think we did a good job explaining our project.
- **What team member learned:** That planning and setting up piece by piece is a more efficient way to code in a group project than to complete a large section alone.
- **Where the team member had trouble and where the team member is stuck:** Haven't fully looked into the Python/Flask API, which will be used on the backend.

**Goals planned for next week:**
- Learn how the Python/Flask API works, and how to implement this into the project
- Complete the documentation level stuff for milestone 4 on the teams living document
- Help with any HTML/CSS/JS issues related to the frontend
