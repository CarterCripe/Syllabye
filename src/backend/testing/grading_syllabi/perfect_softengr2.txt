    "raw_text": "Welcome to CS362: Software Engineering II\nThe objective is to provide a general introduction to the \"back end\" of the software engineering life-cycle involving implementation, verification and validation, debugging, and maintenance.\n\nSoftware testing, debugging, and maintenance are essential skills for every software developer. These practices ensure that the software we create is reliable, efficient, and free from critical bugs that could lead to failures or security vulnerabilities. Testing allows us to validate that our code meets the desired functionality, while debugging helps identify and resolve errors that occur during execution. Maintenance is an ongoing process that ensures software remains functional and adaptable as new challenges and user requirements arise. By mastering these skills, students can contribute to the creation of high-quality, robust software that can stand the test of time and scale with evolving technologies.\n\nCourse Learning Outcomes\nBy the end of this course, you should be able to:\n\nApply Version Control Software such as Git.\nDescribe costs and benefits for using automated testing during software development.\nDescribe the different types of code coverage and how they apply to software quality.\nApply testing techniques, including black-box and white-box testing, regression testing, and automated testing suites.\nParticipate effectively in a software inspection/code review.\nParticipate effectively in a team environment.\nCourse Contents\nSoftware Quality Management: (1) Software Quality (2) Software Standards (3) Reviews and Inspections (4) Software Measurements and Metrics\nSoftware Project Management: (1) Risk Management (2) Managing People (3) Teamwork\nSoftware Testing: (1) Validation and Verification (2) Development Testing (3) Test-Driven Development (4) Release Testing (5) User Testing\nMeet the Instructor\nHi everyone, I'm Dr. Manish Motwani.Links to an external site. I am an Assistant Professor in the School of Electrical Engineering and Computer Science (EECS) at Oregon State University. My broad research interests focus on improving software quality through the automation of software engineering practices. My research involves analyzing large software repositories to discover valuable insights and use that knowledge to design novel automation techniques, such as requirements elicitation, testing, and program repair.\n\nI look forward to working with you all this term and helping you build the skills necessary for success in software engineering.\nSchedule\nThe following is the tentative weekly schedule that might change depending on the progress of the class.

You will work in teams of up to four students to design, develop, test, and deploy a software product over a 9-week period. Starting from an initial idea, your team will iteratively refine requirements, design the system, implement features, apply testing and continuous integration, and produce a final working release.\n\nThe project is structured around seven milestones and three graded deliverables (proposal, midterm, and final presentations/reports) to help you make steady progress. While milestones 1\u20134 (project proposal, requirements elicitation, architecture/design, and initial implementation/documentation) are essential for project success, the technical content required to complete these milestones will not be covered in lectures, as it is expected knowledge from the course prerequisites. That said, the instructor and TAs are available to help\u2014you are strongly encouraged to ask questions, seek feedback, and get unstuck during project meetings, office hours, or via email.\n\nThe final project deliverable will include a public poster presentation, where your team will present your work in a poster-session format. Examples of posters from students who took this course in previous offerings will be provided for reference. These examples are meant to illustrate the expected level of quality and professionalism; you are expected to propose your own original ideas and produce a final product that is comparable in scope and polish, not to replicate prior work.\n\nYou are allowed and encouraged to use all available resources, including documentation, tutorials, and generative AI tools, to help you work on the project. Any such resources must be clearly and appropriately attributed in your project documentation. Reusing or modifying past projects (e.g., changing only the UI or superficial aspects) is strictly prohibited and will be considered plagiarism. Any instance of plagiarism will result in a score of 0 for the entire team.\n\nThroughout the term, your team will follow a professional development workflow: using GitHub for version control and collaboration, submitting weekly status reports, committing artifacts regularly, and participating in bi-weekly in-class project meetings with course staff. The emphasis of the project is not just building a working system, but learning how to work effectively in teams, respond to feedback, manage scope, and follow a structured software engineering process similar to what you will encounter in industry.\n\nFor a more detailed description on the course project, go here.\n\nHomework (30%)\nThere will be three individual homework assignments designed to assess your understanding of core software engineering skills covered in this course, including using Git for version control, writing high-quality tests, and applying automated testing techniques. While each homework must be completed and submitted individually, collaboration is encouraged\u2014you may discuss ideas and approaches with other students, provided that you clearly acknowledge all collaborators in your submission. You will have approximately two weeks to complete each homework. For Homework 2 and Homework 3, there will also be an in-class bootstrap exercise on the assignment release date, during which you will set up the required infrastructure and tooling to help you get started efficiently.\n\nQuizzes (20%)\nThere will be three quizzes in this course designed to evaluate your understanding of key conceptual topics discussed in lectures. The quizzes will cover software maintenance strategies, choosing appropriate automated testing techniques, and fault localization and repair. Each quiz is short and focused, consisting of a small number of questions, and is intended to assess your ability to reason about concepts rather than memorize details. All quizzes will be completed individually and must be submitted by their respective deadlines listed on Canvas. Students may attempt each quiz up to two times during the quiz availability window. There is no time limit for each attempt, and the higher score will be recorded.\n\nIn-Class Exercises (ICEs) (15%)\nThere will be four in-class exercises (ICEs) designed to assess prerequisite skills, provide early hands-on practice, and reinforce key course concepts. The first three ICEs will take place during the first week of the course and are intended to evaluate your readiness for the course while giving you a practical preview of the types of tasks you will encounter in assignments and the course project. These exercises focus on navigating a UNIX-like environment, writing shell scripts, and implementing and evaluating basic data structures. The fourth ICE will occur toward the end of the course and will involve beta testing another team\u2019s project, giving you experience with evaluating real software, providing constructive feedback, and thinking from the perspective of users and testers.\n\nGrading Policy\nHomework: 30% (10% each homework)\nQuizzes: 20% (5% + 5% + 10%)\nIn-Class Exercises: 15% (2% + 3% + 5% + 5%)\nProject: 35% (10% project idea presentation and report,\n                       10% project plan presentation and report,\n                       15% final presentation and report)\n93 \u2013 100: A\n90 \u2013 92:   A-\n87 \u2013 89:   B+\n83 \u2013 86:   B\n80 \u2013 82:   B-\n77 \u2013 79:   C+\n73 \u2013 76:   C\n70 \u2013 72:   C-\n67 \u2013 69:   D+\n63 \u2013 66:   D\n60 \u2013 62:   D-\n     < 60:   F\nLate Submission Policy\nAll assignments come with an automatic 1-day extension. You do not need to email the instructor to use this extension.\n\nIf you require an extension beyond 1 day, you must email the instructor with a valid reason before the assignment's due date. Failure to request an extension in advance will result in a loss of points, as outlined below:\n\n1\u20132 days late: 10% deduction\n3\u20134 days late: 20% deduction\n5\u20136 days late: 30% deduction\n7\u20138 days late: 50% deduction\n9 or more days late: 100% deduction (no credit)\nNondiscrimination Policy\nSoftware engineering is at its nature a collaborative activity and it benefits greatly from diversity. This course includes and welcomes all students regardless of age, background, citizenship, disability, sex, education, ethnicity, family status, gender, gender identity, geographical origin, language, military experience, political views, race, religion, sexual orientation, socioeconomic status, and work experience. Our discussions and learning will benefit from these and other diverse points of view. Any kind of language or action displaying bias against or discriminating against members of any group, or making members of any group uncomfortable are against the mission of this course and will not be tolerated. The instructor welcomes discussion of this policy, and encourages anyone experiencing concerns to speak with him.\n\nAcademic Integrity\nStudents are allowed to work together on all aspects of this class. However, for the homework assignments, each student must submit his or her own write up, clearly stating the collaborators. Your submission must be your own. When in doubt, contact the instructors about whether a potential action would be considered plagiarism. If you discuss material with anyone besides the class staff, acknowledge your collaborators in your write-up. If you obtain a key insight with help (e.g., through library work or a friend), acknowledge your source and write up the summary on your own. It is the student's responsibility to remove any possibility of someone else's work from being misconstrued as the student's. Never misrepresent someone else's work as your own. It must be absolutely clear what material is your original work. Plagiarism and other anti-intellectual behavior will be dealt with severely. Note that facilitation of plagiarism (giving your work to someone else) is also considered to be plagiarism, and will carry the same repercussions.\n\nStudents are encouraged to use the Internet, literature, and other publicly-available resources, except the homework solutions and test (including quizzes, in-class exercises and project artifacts) solutions, from past terms' versions of this course and other academic courses, whether at OSU and at other institutions. To reiterate, the students are not allowed to view and use past homework and test solutions, unless explicitly distributed by the CS 362 staff as study material.\n\nWhenever students use Internet (including generate AI tools such as Claude, Gemini, and ChatGPT), literature, and other publicly-available resources, they must clearly reference the materials in their write ups, attributing proper credit. This cannot be emphasized enough: attribute proper credit to your sources. Failure to do so will result in a zero grade for the assignment and possibly a failing grade for the class, at the instructor's discretion. Copying directly from resources is not permitted, unless the copying is clearly identified as a quote from a source. Most use of references should be written in the words of the student, placing the related work in proper context and describing the relevant comparison.\nSteps to Get Help\nRead again the assignment, lecture slides, and/or reading material provided on syllabus page\nSearch on internet (e.g., using Google) or using generative AI (e.g., ChatGPT, Gemini, Claude, etc.) and understand the suggested readings.\nAsk a friend or classmate.\nCheck the Canvas Discussion Section and Course Discord Channel Links to an external site. for relevant posts or create a new question <-- This is often the fastest approach\nAsk a TA:\nYou can attend office hours virtually (see the TA Office Hours page)\nAttend Dr. Motwani' office hours.\nOffice hours will take place in my office located in the Kelley Engineering Center room 3043 each Wednesday from 1100 to 1300.\nCommunication Policy\nPlease post all course-related questions in the General Q&A Discussion so the entire class can benefit from our conversation.\nAvoid using the Canvas mailbox because it doesn't work very well.
