## Project Description
Syllabye is a browser extension that helps students easily access and search their course syllabi. Students can upload all their syllabi to the extension and quickly search across them to find specific information like late work policies, grading breakdowns, or citation guidelines without navigating through Canvas or hunting through downloaded files.
